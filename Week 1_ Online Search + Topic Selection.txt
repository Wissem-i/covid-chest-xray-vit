In this assignment, I am asking you to search the internet and complete the following sections in a
document.
1) Keywords: List the keywords you have used to search the internet. You could potentially bundle them
after the search is over and after the team has met to discuss the results.
For the following items, no need to write an abstract or start any literature review. I am asking only for
lists of Links. Nothing more.
2) List a minimum of five research paper in the area of your interest.
This is team’s interest(s). This is not individual’s interest.
Please make sure the links refer to papers that are published after 2022.
See if the paper has graphs, tables, flowcharts, results and discussions, preferably in the form of
comparisons between proposed technique and older techniques listed in the paper.
Preference is given to journal papers over conference papers. But if you have one or two conference
papers with high quality in the batch of your links, I am OK with that too.
Note: You are allowed to have only ONE paper from Papers with codes website. This website is not peer
reviewed. All other papers must be selected from journals that are peer reviewed.
3) List a minimum of three links to presentations in the area of team interest. These presentations can be
either in the form of PPT or PDF that originated from a PPT.
4) Looking at the techniques that authors have used, list a minimum of three youtube clips that discuss
and address the techniques in relatively simple way. For example, if your interest is using Rainforest
algorithm, try to provide a link for that so that the team can benefit. If your technique is XGBoost, have
one link to explain what XGBoost is.
5) List GitHub or any online repositories that could be your baseline codesets.
Submit the following two items:
A document that has the answers to the items 1 to 5 listed above.
A recording where the group has discussed the outcomes. Please note that each team member can
do search independently. But there must be a group discussion. The length of this recording is
