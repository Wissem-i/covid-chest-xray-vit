# Week 1: Online Search + Topic Selection

## 1. Keywords Used for Internet Search

I spent a lot of time trying different search terms to find good papers and resources. Here's what I searched for:

**Main keywords:**
- Computer Vision
- Vision Transformer
- Medical imaging AI
- Chest X-ray classification
- Deep learning medical
- COVID-19 detection AI

**More specific searches:**
- "Vision Transformer medical images"
- "CNN vs transformer chest xray" 
- "COVID-19 AI diagnosis 2023"
- "pytorch vision transformer tutorial"

I mostly used Google Scholar and ArXiv. Sometimes I had to try different combinations to find what I was looking for.
