Note: There are three reasons we do this exercise.
1) It is a self-assessment tool to see how much time you have spent for this course in this particular
week. The more time you spend, the better the result. In fact, I need you to spend a minimum of five (5)
hours per week on average.
2) This also gives your supervisor (in this case the professor or the TAs of the course) to observe your
activities and intervene if needed.
3) It is now customary in mid-size and large companies to record your activities online. You are being
asked to exercise this assignment now so that it becomes routine for you when you join a research
group in either academic settings or private sector.
Please complete Sample Activity Log for this week. It is a DOC file. This assignment is individual. The
DOC file is uploaded before this assignment in the home screen.
Please avoid general statements and be as specific as you can. General statement will earn you zero.
Example of General Statement: I worked with my team.
Specific Statement: I visited Youtube and watched the following tutorials on how to start PhP coding.
Here are the list of URLs that I have visited.
When mentioning team work, please state with whom did you work, and how long and what date and on
what assignment.
Note also that this assignment has impact in the individual scaling factor. Your statement, if team
members are involved, should be verifiable by other members of your team.
If you are a single-member team, you only need to report as precisely as possible on the activities you
have carried by yourself.
