# Week 1: Team Formation

## Team Member Names

Sarah Johnson

## Team Formation Status

I'm working by myself on this project. I couldn't find anyone else to team up with and honestly I prefer working alone anyway. I know I'll have to do all the work myself but that's fine with me.

## Why I'm Working Alone

I decided to work individually because:
- I like controlling my own schedule and deadlines
- I work better when I don't have to coordinate with other people
- I can focus on the topics I'm most interested in (computer vision and medical imaging)
- I don't have to worry about team conflicts or people not pulling their weight

I understand this means I'll have more work to do, but I'm committed to completing all the assignments on time and doing quality work.
1. Focus deeply on a specific research area without coordination overhead
2. Learn all aspects of the machine learning pipeline comprehensively
3. Take full ownership of the project outcomes
4. Develop stronger independent research skills
5. Progress at my own pace while meeting all deadlines

## Commitment Statement

I understand that working individually means I will be responsible for all aspects of the project including research, implementation, testing, and documentation. I commit to dedicating a minimum of 5 hours per week to this course as required.

I am prepared to handle the increased workload and take full responsibility for:
- Literature review and parent paper selection
- Data acquisition and preprocessing
- Model implementation and training
- Results analysis and documentation
- All weekly deliverables
