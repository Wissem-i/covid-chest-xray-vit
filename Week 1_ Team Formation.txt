You have raised the possibility of changing your teammates or taking your time in selecting your
teammate via your feedback in Fall 2024.
Therefore, I am asking you to
1) either re-confirm that you are sticking to your team or teammates,
2) or to name a new team you have moved to.
This assignment allows you to re-organize your team formation to meet your maximum satisfaction.
Please type in the names of your team members including yours.
