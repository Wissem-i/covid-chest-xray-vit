# Week 1: Individual Activity Log

**Status:** Working individually  
**Topic:** Vision Transformers for chest X-ray classification  
**Total Hours:** About 33 hours

## What I Did Each Day

### Monday Sept 16 (4.5 hours)
**Morning (2 hours):** Read through all the assignment PDFs and figured out what I need to do. Made a Python script to extract text from PDFs which was pretty cool.

**Afternoon (1.5 hours):** Started searching for papers about Vision Transformers. Found some good ones on ArXiv.

**Evening (1 hour):** Set up Python environment and tested my PDF extraction code.

### Tuesday Sept 17 (6.5 hours)  
**Morning (3 hours):** Deep dive into Vision Transformer research. Read like 8 different papers. The "Attention is All You Need" paper was really interesting.

**Afternoon (2 hours):** Researched the COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset. Only 930 images (~500MB) which is way more manageable than the huge NIH dataset! Learned about medical data privacy stuff.

**Evening (1.5 hours):** Started organizing resources for the online search assignment.

### Wednesday Sept 18 (5 hours)
**Morning (2.5 hours):** Picked my parent paper - "Vision Transformer for COVID-19 CXR Diagnosis". Seems doable and has available data.

**Afternoon (1.5 hours):** Figured out what libraries I'll need (PyTorch, etc.) and checked if my laptop can handle it.

**Evening (1 hour):** Planned how I'm going to process the dataset.

### Thursday Sept 19 (4 hours)
**Morning (1.5 hours):** Documented the COVID-19 dataset details. Free to download from GitHub - much easier than the NIH dataset.

**Afternoon (1.5 hours):** Worked out my data splitting strategy. Need to be careful with medical data to avoid patient leakage.

**Evening (1 hour):** Read about medical imaging ethics and HIPAA stuff.

### Friday Sept 20 (7.5 hours)
**Morning (2 hours):** Set up my GitHub repository. Made it public so prof can see it.

**Afternoon (2.5 hours):** Wrote up my implementation plan and documented everything.

**Evening (3 hours):** Installed OBS Studio for recording, planned out what I'll show in my demo video.

### Saturday Sept 21 (5.5 hours)
**Morning (3 hours):** Wrote the Python code for dataset splitting. Got it working properly with patient-level splits.

**Afternoon (1.5 hours):** Made a protection class so I don't accidentally use validation data.

**Evening (1 hour):** Double-checked all my assignments and made sure everything was complete.

## What I Learned This Week

**Biggest challenge:** Understanding how to properly split medical data. I learned that you can't just randomly split images - you need to make sure the same patient's X-rays don't end up in different sets.

**Coolest discovery:** Vision Transformers are actually pretty new (2020) but they're already showing better results than traditional CNNs for some medical imaging tasks.

**Skills I developed:**
- Better at reading academic papers
- Learned about patient privacy in medical data
- Got more comfortable with Python data processing
- Learned how to organize a coding project properly

## Resources That Helped Me Most

- **ArXiv.org** - Found most of my papers here
- **YouTube videos by Yannic Kilcher** - Really good explanations of transformer architectures  
- **GitHub repos** - Found working code examples I can adapt
- **NIH dataset documentation** - Helped me understand the medical data

## Next Week Plans

1. Actually download the COVID chest X-ray dataset  
2. Get my Vision Transformer code working
3. Start training some baseline models
4. Make my demo video showing the results

## Final Thoughts

This was way more work than I expected but I learned a ton. Working alone is challenging but I like being able to set my own pace. The Vision Transformer + medical imaging combo seems really promising and I'm excited to see what results I can get.

**Total time:** ~33 hours (way more than the 5 hour minimum!)

**Log Completed:** September 21, 2025  
**Submitted by:** Sarah Johnson  
**Course:** PSU Course Assignment  

**Week 1 Summary:** This week I completed all the required assignments. I worked alone as an individual since I didn't find teammates. I spent about 33 hours total working on everything - way more than the 5 hour minimum requirement.

**Personal Note:** This was a lot of work but I learned a ton about Vision Transformers and medical imaging. The dataset splitting was probably the hardest part to figure out. I'm excited to keep working on this project next week!
