You need to make sure the paper you have selected has identified clearly where the data is coming
from. Without having 1st hand access to the data, you will not be able to move to implementation phase.
Please upload a link to the data set the paper has used. Alternatively, you can upload the data (if it is not
too large) as a file in this section.
I encourage creating a GitHub as well as you will upload your materials as you progress in this course.
