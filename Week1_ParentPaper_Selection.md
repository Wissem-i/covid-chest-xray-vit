# Week 1: Parent Paper Selection

## My Selected Parent Paper

**Paper Title:** "Vision Transformer for COVID-19 CXR Diagnosis using Chest X-ray Feature Corpus"

**Authors:** Sangjoon Park, Gwanghyun Kim, Yujin Oh, Joon Beom Seo, Sang Min Lee, Jin Hwan Kim, Sungjun Moon, Jae-Kwang Lim, Jong Chul Ye

**Where I Found It:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07055

**Publication Year:** 2023

## Why I Chose This Paper

I picked this paper because:

1. **It's recent** - Published in 2023 so it meets the requirements
2. **I can get the data** - Uses chest X-ray datasets that are publicly available 
3. **It has good results** - Shows clear comparisons between Vision Transformers and regular CNNs
4. **I can probably implement it** - There are GitHub repos with similar code I can adapt
5. **It's interesting to me** - Medical AI is something I want to learn more about

The paper basically takes the Vision Transformer architecture (originally designed for regular photos) and adapts it to work on chest X-rays for COVID-19 detection. They show that transformers can actually work better than traditional CNNs for this kind of medical imaging task.
- CheXpert Dataset (224,316 images) 
- MIMIC-CXR Dataset (377,110 images)
- COVID-19 specific datasets (various sources, ~15,000 images)

**Key Results:**
- ViT achieved 94.2% accuracy on COVID-19 detection
- 15% improvement over ResNet-50 baseline
- Superior performance on pneumonia classification (92.8% vs 89.1%)
- Better attention alignment with radiologist annotations

**Comparison Techniques:**
- ResNet-50, ResNet-101
- DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169
- EfficientNet-B4
- Various CNN architectures with transfer learning

### Can I Actually Do This?

**Code Availability:**
Authors provide code in supplementary materials
Code available on GitHub (unofficial implementations)
Similar implementations available in timm library

**Data Accessibility:**
Dataset is publicly available (NIH Chest X-ray)
CheXpert dataset requires free registration

**Technical Requirements:**
- Programming Language: Python 3.8+
- Required Libraries: PyTorch, timm, transformers, torchvision, scikit-learn
- Computational Resources: GPU recommended (RTX 3080 or better), 16GB+ RAM
- Estimated Implementation Time: 2-3 weeks

### Rationale for Selection

**Why this paper?**
1. **Clear method and I can follow it** - Good experimental setup with details on settings
2. **Dataset I can download for free** - NIH Chest X-ray dataset is available online
3. **Recent paper with good results** - 2023 paper showing big improvements
4. **Code is available** - Multiple GitHub repos with ViT medical imaging code
5. **Important for helping people** - Medical diagnosis with real-world uses
6. **Good comparisons with other models** - Tests against multiple CNN types

**Questions I Want to Look At:**
1. How does Vision Transformer work compared to CNN on smaller chest X-ray datasets?
2. Can I improve accuracy with better data techniques?
3. How do different Vision Transformer sizes (ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) work on medical images?
4. Can I understand what the model is looking at by studying attention?

### Alternative Papers Considered

**Paper 2:**
- Title: "EfficientNet for COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-ray Images"
- Reason not selected: Less novel approach, EfficientNet is well-established, limited research potential

**Paper 3:**
- Title: "BERT for Medical Text Classification"
- Reason not selected: Different domain (NLP vs Computer Vision), preferred to focus on image analysis
