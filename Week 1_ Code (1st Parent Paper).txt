The 1st phase of implementation requires you to redo what the authors of the parent paper have done.
You could find the appropriate code on github, on Kaggle, or via search on Database search of Google.
Some suggestions are made in the announcement sections. Without having the codes, you will be
required to develop the codes from scratch. So, try to find a paper that is very clear how the
implementation is done.
1) Make a github account and upload the codes there. Make the GitHub public so that the TA and I can
access them.
2) Provide a recording that shows you have clicked on the code and you have run the code on
the screen. It must run without an error on the recorded screen.
Please note I am not asking you to modify the code or write the code from scratch. I am asking you to
execute the code you have selected from internet. This code will be the basis on which your research
paper will be based. While you may change the code at a later stage in consultation with the instructor,
you need to make sure your selected code is working at this stage.
