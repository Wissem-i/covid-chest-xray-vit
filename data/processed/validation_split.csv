There is hazy opacity in the right lower zone medially and the right heart border is not visualized.  This could be misinterpreted as an additional right middle lobe consolidation, however this is in fact due to a pectus excavatum deformity, which is suggested by the orientation of the ribs and is confirmed on the lateral film. . Discussion: This case demonstrates the typical appearance of pectus excavatum on frontal chest radiographs and how one might be tempted to incorrectly report right middle lobe pathology especially in the setting of respiratory tract symptoms.
