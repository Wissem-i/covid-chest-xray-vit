# üéØ GITHUB WORK CHECKLIST - PSU Week 1 Assignment

## What the Assignment Files Say I Need to Do

From **Week 1: Code (1st Parent Paper).txt**:
> "Make a github account and upload the codes there. Make the GitHub public so that the TA and I can access them."
> "Provide a recording that shows you have clicked on the code and you have run the code on the screen. It must run without an error on the recorded screen."

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY DONE

### Local Repository Ready
- [x] Git repository initialized locally
- [x] All code files created and tested
- [x] Working data splitting code (verified)
- [x] Vision Transformer implementation complete
- [x] Demo script that shows everything works
- [x] requirements.txt with all dependencies
- [x] Professional README.md ready

---

## üîÑ WHAT I STILL NEED TO DO

### 1. **Create GitHub Account & Repository**
- [ ] Go to github.com and create account (or login if have one)
- [ ] Create new repository named: `covid-chest-xray-vit`
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Make sure repository is **PUBLIC** (TA and professor must access)
- [ ] Add description: "Week 1 Code Assignment - Vision Transformer for COVID-19 Classification"

### 2. **Upload All Code Files**
**Required files to upload:**
- [ ] `vit_covid19_classifier.py` - Main Vision Transformer implementation
- [ ] `create_dataset_splits.py` - Data splitting code (already working)
- [ ] `test_dataset_splits.py` - Data validation
- [ ] `demo_assignment.py` - System demonstration 
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies
- [ ] `README.md` - Project documentation
- [ ] All 7 assignment `.md` files (Week1_*.md)

### 3. **Upload Methods (Choose One)**

**Method A - Web Interface (Easier):**
1. In GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all .py files 
3. Commit with message: "Week 1 assignment - Initial upload"

**Method B - Command Line:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/covid-chest-xray-vit.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. **Test Repository Access**
- [ ] Open repository URL in incognito browser (test public access)
- [ ] Verify all files are visible
- [ ] Copy repository URL for submission
- [ ] Test that README.md displays properly

### 5. **Download Dataset & Test Code**
- [ ] Run: `git clone https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.git`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Test code runs: `python demo_assignment.py`
- [ ] Verify data splitting: `python create_dataset_splits.py`

### 6. **Create Screen Recording**
**Must show in recording:**
- [ ] Opening the GitHub repository
- [ ] Downloading/cloning the repository 
- [ ] Installing requirements
- [ ] Running the code successfully
- [ ] **Code must run WITHOUT ERRORS** (assignment requirement)
- [ ] Show model training or data processing results

**Recording specs:**
- [ ] 20-25 minutes showing complete process
- [ ] Clear screen capture (1080p recommended)
- [ ] Save as: `covid_vit_demo.mp4`

### 7. **Final Submission**
**What to submit:**
- [ ] GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/[USERNAME]/covid-chest-xray-vit`
- [ ] Screen recording file
- [ ] Verify repository stays public throughout course
