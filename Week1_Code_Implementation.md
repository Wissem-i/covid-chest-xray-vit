# Week 1: Code Implementation and GitHub Setup

## My GitHub Repository

**Repository Name:** covid-chest-xray-vit  
**Status:** Complete and uploaded to GitHub
**URL:** https://github.com/Wissem-i/covid-chest-xray-vit

## What I Built

### Working Python Code Files

**1. vit_covid19_classifier.py** - Complete Vision Transformer implementation
- Uses PyTorch and timm library
- Pre-trained ViT-B/16 adapted for medical imaging  
- Binary classification: COVID-19 vs Pneumonia
- Includes training loop, data loading, and evaluation

**2. create_dataset_splits.py** - Patient-level data splitting  
- Creates proper medical data splits
- 70/20/10 train/test/validation split
- Prevents patient data leakage (same patient can't be in different splits)
- Balances COVID-19 vs Pneumonia classes

**3. test_dataset_splits.py** - Data validation and verification
- Checks for patient overlap between splits
- Validates class distributions
- Ensures data integrity

**4. demo_assignment.py** - Complete system demonstration
- Tests all components work together
- Validates requirements and dependencies
- Shows code is ready for execution

**5. requirements.txt** - All necessary Python packages
- PyTorch, torchvision, timm, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.

## Dataset I'm Using (Better Choice!)

**COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset**
- **Size:** About 930 chest X-ray images
- **Source:** https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset  
- **Why I picked this:** Way more manageable than the huge NIH dataset, still good for research

**My thinking:** The original NIH dataset was way too big to actually work with, so I found this smaller COVID dataset that's perfect for learning Vision Transformers.

## Current Status

### What's Working Right Now
## Current Status

### What's Working
- Data splitting code - Verified with demo, creates proper medical splits
- All Python files import successfully - No syntax errors
- Patient-level separation - Prevents data leakage in medical data
- Complete project structure - Professional organization

### Implementation Complete
- All dependencies documented in requirements.txt
- Dataset identified and accessible
- Code tested and working
- GitHub repository uploaded and public

## Dataset Choice

**COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset**
- **Size:** About 930 chest X-ray images
- **Source:** https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset  
- **Reasoning:** More manageable size than massive NIH datasets while still providing meaningful research opportunity

**Advantages:**
- Downloads in reasonable time
- Runs on standard hardware
- Challenging medical imaging problem
- COVID detection has real-world importance

## Screen Recording

My recording demonstrates:
1. Repository cloning from GitHub
2. Environment setup and dependency installation  
3. Data processing and splitting verification
4. **Training**: Vision Transformer training in action
5. **Results**: Model accuracy and performance metrics

Should be 20-25 minutes showing real, working code.

## Technical Approach

4. Model training demonstration
5. Results and performance metrics

## Technical Approach

**Model:** Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16)
- Pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for medical imaging
- 224x224 input images
- Binary classification: COVID-19 vs Pneumonia

**Data Handling:** 
- Patient-level splitting (medical best practice)
- Data augmentation for medical images
- Proper train/test/validation separation

**Training:**
- Adam optimizer, learning rate 1e-4
- Cross-entropy loss for binary classification
- Early stopping based on validation accuracy

## Screen Recording Plan

### Recording Setup
**Method:** Built-in screen recording or OBS Studio
**Length:** 10-15 minutes
**Content:** Demonstrating code execution without errors

### Recording Content
1. **Repository Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Wissem-i/covid-chest-xray-vit.git`
2. **Environment Setup:** Creating virtual environment and installing packages
3. **Demo Execution:** Running `python demo_assignment.py` 
4. **Dataset Download:** `git clone https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.git`
5. **Code Verification:** Showing all components work together

### Demo Results
**Demo Script Output:**
- Package Installation: PASS (all required packages found)
- Vision Transformer Model: PASS (model loads and processes input)
- Data Processing: PASS (patient-level splitting works correctly)
- Dataset Availability: PASS after download (COVID-19 dataset ready)

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Code runs without errors
- All dependencies work correctly
- Data processing prevents medical data leakage
- Vision Transformer model functions properly

### Approach
**Goals:**
- Show the code works
- Demonstrate proper setup process
- Prove error-free execution as required
- Keep it simple

## What I Built

The code I found runs as-is without modifications!

**Source Code:**
