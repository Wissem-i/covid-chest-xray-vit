You need to select, via team consultation, the parent paper that you will implement initially in this course.
No need to do any implementation at this time. But the topic needs to be selected and a parent paper
that has the following properties is identified. You need to upload the PDF of the paper paper and the link
from which the paper has been sourced.
The parent paper is the main paper in this course. It has graphs, tables, figures, possibly flow charts
(optional). It has identified where the data is collected from. It has methodologies, results and
conclusions. It must be published anywhere between 2022 until present time. (It should NOT be older
than 2020 unless approved by the Professor.)
1) Please note this paper must be a peer-reviewed paper. It cannot be coming off of a social net,
medium.com or Kaggle. Only one paper selected from the website called "papers with codes" is allowed.
2) You need to provide a reference link (URL) to the paper. You may have changed the parent paper.
Regardless, upload the link.
3) You need to have actual possession of the paper and you need to upload a DOC or PDF version of
the parent paper you have reviewed.
